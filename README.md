# Dynaboard-Website-Project

My first huge project:)) Replica of Dynaboard website, i only used img and svg elements from the website everything
else was 100% made and coded by me, atm can't figure out how to save theme state(after changing from blue to red)

P.S my js is still a bit of a mess, learning it on Udemy atm
